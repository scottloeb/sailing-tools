## 🏆 Selected Foundation: Dusker Surf Tracking App

### Why Dusker is Perfect for Sailing Complications
- **MIT License**: Open source, free to modify and build upon
- **Existing Watch Complications**: Already implements the complication framework
- **Marine Data Focus**: Designed for surf/marine weather data
- **Native SwiftUI**: Modern, maintainable codebase
- **External API Integration**: Framework for weather/marine data APIs

### 🌊 Dusker's Existing Marine Complications
From the project specification, Dusker already includes:
- **Wind direction** ⭐ (critical for sailing)
- **Water temperature** ⭐ (useful for sailing)
- **Tide information** ⭐ (essential for sailing)
- **Swell size and direction** ⭐ (important for sailing)
- **Water level** ⭐ (useful for sailing)
- **Sunset time** (helpful for planning)

### 🔧 Technical Architecture
- **Watch App Components**: SwiftUI-based with sensor integration
- **External APIs**: Weather/swell data providers (Surfline, NOAA)
- **Data Sync**: iCloud/CloudKit integration
- **Health Integration**: HealthKit for workout tracking
- **Complications Framework**: Already implemented for marine data

## 📊 Project Evaluation Results

### Rejected Options
1. **iOS-Open-GPX-Tracker**
   - ❌ GPS tracking duplicates Argo functionality
   - ❌ No marine weather data
   - ❌ Would increase battery drain
   - ❌ Not focused on complications

2. **Building from scratch**
   - ❌ Time-intensive
   - ❌ Would duplicate existing complication frameworks
   - ❌ Higher risk of implementation issues

3. **Argo API Integration**
   - ❌ No public API available
   - ❌ Developer (Jeff Foulk/Argo Navigation LLC) would need to be contacted
   - ❌ Uncertain response/timeline

### ✅ Why Dusker Wins
- ✅ Already solves 90% of the technical challenges
- ✅ Marine-focused data sources
- ✅ Modern Swift/SwiftUI codebase
- ✅ Active complication framework
- ✅ Open source (MIT license)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## 🎯 Current Hardware Setup

### Watch Configuration
- **Device**: Apple Watch (non-Ultra)
- **Watch Face**: Infographic Pro
- **Current Apps**: Weathergraph ($24.99/year), TIDES (free), Windy.app ($84.99/year)
- **Current Cost**: $110/year in subscriptions

### Vessel Information
- **Boat**: Jeanneau Sun Odyssey 385
- **Instruments**: Raymarine
- **Current Tracking**: Argo Nav
- **Target**: Reduce subscription costs while improving functionality

## 🚀 Next Development Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)
1. **Open Dusker in Xcode**: `open ~/SailingWatch-Evaluation/dusker/Dusker.xcodeproj`
2. **Examine complication implementation**: Study how existing marine complications work
3. **Test build and deployment**: Ensure project builds and runs on Apple Watch
4. **Analyze API integration**: Understand how weather data is fetched and displayed

### Phase 1: Understanding & Adaptation (Week 1-2)
- Study Dusker's complication architecture
- Identify which complications are most relevant for sailing
- Test existing weather API integrations
- Modify UI to prioritize sailing-specific data

### Phase 2: Sailing-Specific Enhancements (Week 3-4)
- Add heading/bearing calculations (trajectory-based, not compass-based)
- Enhance wind data visualization for sailing contexts
- Integrate additional marine data sources if needed
- Optimize complications for sailing watch face layouts

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Week 5-6)
- Real-world testing while sailing
- Battery optimization
- Integration with existing sailing workflow (alongside Argo)
- Fine-tune data refresh rates and accuracy

## 🧭 Key Technical Requirements

### Critical Sailing Data
- **Wind**: Direction, speed, gusts (most critical)
- **Tide**: Current state, next change, height
- **Heading**: Trajectory-based (not compass-based for watch orientation independence)
- **Weather**: Conditions affecting sailing decisions

### User Experience Requirements
- **Single-handed operation**: Minimal interaction required
- **Sunlight readability**: High contrast, clear visuals
- **Battery efficiency**: Long sailing sessions without charging
- **Quick glance information**: Essential data at a glance

## 📋 Development Resources

### Documentation
- Dusker spec.md: Comprehensive development specification
- Apple Watch complications documentation
- Marine weather API documentation (NOAA, Surfline)

### Code Repositories
- **Primary**: `~/SailingWatch-Evaluation/dusker/`

## 🤖 Note for Claude

This project has identified an excellent foundation in the Dusker surf tracking app. The next conversation should focus on:
- Opening and exploring the Dusker project in Xcode
- Understanding the existing complication architecture
- Identifying specific modifications needed for sailing use cases
- Planning the adaptation from surf-focused to sailing-focused complications

Key insight: Instead of building from scratch, we're adapting an existing marine-focused complication framework, which should significantly reduce development time and complexity.
